## Project Overview
This Website was created for the purpose of completing the first Milestone Project for the Code Institute's Full Stack Developer Course.
It was build using the knowledge gained from the HTML, CSS and User Centric Design Modules.

The live website can be found [here].(https://vijusuren.github.io/my-first-repo1/index.html).

The OD'S Restaurant Website was built at the request of Owner. The client wanted a fully responsive website that could be used to advertise and showcase their dishes. The client wants the ability to increase customer though the website.

- To create a website that is speaking directly to the viewer, giving a clear idea and description of the OD'S Restaurant.

- To create a responsive design fitting all devices and screen sizes.

## User Stories

- The Customer's Reviews motivated me to create a website that transmitted the same enthusiasm people have when visiting the OD'S Restaurant.

- A standard layout is fully responsive on mobile devices and larger screens.
